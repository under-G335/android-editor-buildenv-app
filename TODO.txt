TODO
====

- Get Gradle build running to completion
  - Detect and solve the AAPT thing
- We should bind the whole shared Documents directory, not just the given project (so other stuff can be found)
  - Or, just bind all of `/storage`?
  - I wonder if this might fix our issues with `getcwd` not working in there?
- Godot: Show better progress to the user
  - Popup the window and show output
    - Should we combine stdout and stderr? My inclination is "yes"
  - Have a way to cancel the build
    - We probably need to do better with threads?
  - Only return control to the user when the build has finished or been canceled
- Godot: Clean up
  - Make separate class/object for the Gradle bits
  - Remove the old Termux bits
- Figure out which Termux fork we need (and update build system to use it)

Notes:

- It looks like we need to copy the `android/build` directory into the rootfs for this to work
- We should bind the whole shared Documents directory into the rootfs, so any output directory for the Gradle artifacts will work
- I'm not sure if we still need green-green-avk's fork or can use the termux fork - I've gone back and forth too many times
