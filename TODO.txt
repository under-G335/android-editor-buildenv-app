TODO
====

- Godot: Show better progress to the user
  - Popup the window and show output
    - Should we combine stdout and stderr? My inclination is "yes"
  - Have a way to cancel the build
    - We probably need to do better with threads?
  - Only return control to the user when the build has finished or been canceled
  - Need the following messages (let's not do a "PREPARE_PROJECT" - it can just be baked in)
    - EXECUTE_GRADLE
    - CANCEL_COMMAND
    - CLEAN_PROJECT
- Godot: Clean up
  - Make separate class/object for the Gradle bits
  - Remove the old Termux bits
- Figure out which Termux fork we need (and update build system to use it)
- Build the Android SDK tools from source
  - https://github.com/lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools
- Storing projects
  - We should have a "projects" directory under the app files (next to "rootfs")
  - We should bind it into the proot environment as `/projects`
  - We should name the directories after a hash of the full path the project came from

Notes:

- It looks like we need to copy the `android/build` directory into the rootfs for this to work
- We should bind the whole shared Documents directory into the rootfs, so any output directory for the Gradle artifacts will work
- I'm not sure if we still need green-green-avk's fork or can use the termux fork - I've gone back and forth too many times
