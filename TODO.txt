TODO
====

- Storing projects
  - We should have a "projects" directory under the app files (next to "rootfs")
  - We should bind it into the proot environment as `/projects`
  - We should name the directories after a hash of the full path the project came from
- Implement `cleanProject` and have it copy the contents of the temp directory back to the original
  - ... and then delete the original
- Fix issue with it finding the debug keystore after rebasing on Godot 4.5
- Build the Android SDK tools from source
  - https://github.com/lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools
- Check that Godot (and only Godot) is connecting to the service
- Add some simple UI to install and delete the Linux rootfs
  - Do this on another thread and with a nice progress bar
