TODO

- Get a gradle build running in some form or fashion
  - Can we get more frequent writing to the log with progress as it runs?

Notes:

- It looks like we need to copy the `android/build` directory into the rootfs for this to work
- We should bind the whole shared Documents directory into the rootfs, so any output directory for the Gradle artifacts will work
- I'm not sure if we still need green-green-avk's fork or can use the termux fork - I've gone back and forth too many times
